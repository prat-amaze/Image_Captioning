# Project Overview
The image captioning project involves the following key steps:

Feature Extraction: A CNN-based feature extraction model is developed using VGG16. This model enables the extraction of meaningful features from the input images, capturing important visual information.

Caption Generation: The extracted image features are seamlessly translated into coherent and contextually-aware captions using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. LSTM models are known for their ability to effectively model sequential data, making them suitable for generating captions.

Multi-Model Integration: The project showcases expertise in integrating diverse neural network architectures. By combining the feature extraction model and the caption generation model, the system can generate accurate captions that effectively describe the content of the input images.
